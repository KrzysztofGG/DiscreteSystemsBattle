# DiscreteSystemsBattle
## Instalation
In order to launch our simulation you have to first clone our Github repository using command:
```
git clone https://github.com/KrzysztofGG/DiscreteSystemsBattle.git
```
Then in DiscreteSystemsBattle folder you have to run one of two commands:
```
python main.py
```
```
python main_with_layout.py
```
The first command will launch a simulation with units already on the field, without the option to
select their starting points and their quantity. The second one will open a GUI that allows user to
choose unit types and their location. In order to run simulation, finish adding units and press finish
submitting.

## Usage


  - Historical battle simulation - we can use our software to see the possible outcomes of historical battles and further explore used strategies and traps.
  - Planning and simulating future clashes - testing possible courses of the battles and creating a strategy with a help of a visualized battle. Also it can help to counter opponent's  tactics.
  - PvP Game - we think this approach of a sandbox PyGame environment can lead to a creation of a game where two opponents can choose unit layout and fight with each other. Initial resources can be determined and even micro payments to unlock new units or speed up unit making and more.
