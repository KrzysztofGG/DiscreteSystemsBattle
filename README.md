# DiscreteSystemsBattle
In order to launch our simulation you have to first clone our Github repository using command:
git clone https://github.com/KrzysztofGG/DiscreteSystemsBattle.git
Then in DiscreteSystemsBattle folder you have to run one of two commands:
python main.py
python main_with_layout.py
The first command will launch a simulation with units already on the field, without the option to
select their starting points and their quantity. The second one will open a GUI that allows user to
choose unit types and their location. In order to run simulation, finish adding units and press finish
submitting.
